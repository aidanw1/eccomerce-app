Reducers -
state is changed through reducers
reducers are functions which accept actions and
responsible for manipulating and passing the state down to components

Actions - 
objects that represent the intention to change a piece of state

Action creators - 
functions that will dispatch/fire off those actions

Redux thunk -
in our action creators it allows us to make async requests because we need to talk to 
our server through those action creators - piece of middleware

Example
action creator called get products 
action creator makes a fetch request to the backend to get data using a http library
we get the data back and dispatch an action to the reducer and attach a payload to it
payload will have the fetch data
in the reducer we can assign the payload data to the state and pass it down to components
